WHEAT:  U.S. wheat supply, use, and stocks
projections for 2006/07 are unchanged this month.  The
season-average farm price is projected at $4.20 to $4.30
per bushel, up 5 cents on the lower end of the range and
down 15 cents on the upper end from last month.

Global 2006/07 wheat production is projected 1.3 million
tons higher this month, due to upward adjustments in
FSU-12 that more than offset reductions in EU-25.  The
largest production changes are a 2.0-million-ton
increase in Kazakhstan and a 0.7-million-ton decrease in
EU-25.  Global consumption is raised 1.8 million tons
with increases in Canada, EU-25, and FSU-12.  The
increase in Canada reflects stronger feeding use as
implied by recently released stock data.  Consumption is
lowered for Libya and Turkey and results in lower
expected imports for these countries.  Exports for
Russia are raised 0.5 million tons as exports for EU-25
are lowered the same amount.  Smaller changes in a
number of other countries result in the small month-to-
month increase in world exports.  Global ending stocks
for 2006/07 are lowered 1.0 million tons.  Stocks are
lowered for Canada and EU-25.  Despite reductions for
Russia, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan, stocks rise in FSU-12
as increases are projected for other member states,
especially Kazakhstan.

COARSE GRAINS:  U.S. supply, use, and stocks
projections for 2006/07 corn, barley, and oats are
unchanged this month.  Corn exports are unchanged
this month despite stronger competition from South
America supplies as Mexico corn imports are increased. 
U.S. sorghum exports are lowered 5 million bushels
based on slowing U.S. shipments and sales to Mexico
even as corn shipments and sales remain strong. 
Projections for the corn and oats season-average farm
prices are unchanged this month at $3.00 to $3.40 per
bushel and $1.75 to $1.95 per bushel, respectively.  The
barley price range is lowered 10 cents on the top end to
$2.75 to $2.95 per bushel reflecting prices received by
producers to date. The sorghum price range is projected
10 cents higher on both ends of the range to $3.10 to
$3.50 per bushel.  Sorghum prices are forecast above
corn prices this month as less sorghum forward
contracting, compared with corn, has kept average
prices received by producers higher for sorghum than
for corn.  Also boosting sorghum prices relative to corn
are high feed grain prices in the Southern Plains where
a substantial portion of the sorghum crop is produced
and marketed.

Global 2006/07 coarse grain production is raised 4.8
million tons this month on improved prospects for corn
crops in South America.  Corn production for Argentina
is raised 2 million tons to 21 million.  Brazil corn
production is raised 4 million tons to 46 million.  Both
increases are based on good growing season weather
as reflected in recent area and yield indications. 
Supportive weather and higher prices also favor
increased area for second-crop corn in Brazil.  Partly
offsetting these increases is a 0.5-million-ton decrease
for South Africa corn production.  South Africa corn
output is projected at 9.5 million tons on lower reported
area and declining yield prospects as heat and dryness
have stressed crops in the western Maize Triangle. 
Other coarse grain production changes include
reductions for Australia sorghum; Ukraine barley, oats,
and corn; and Turkey corn.  Other production increases
include Kazakhstan barley and India corn.

World coarse grain consumption is raised 3 million tons
this month as improving supply prospects support
stronger global use.  Corn feed use for Brazil is revised
higher for 2005/06 and projected higher for 2006/07
based on indications of stronger poultry and hog feeding
demand.  Global coarse grain exports are raised 2.8
million tons with the biggest increases for Argentina and
Brazil corn.  Corn imports for Mexico are raised 0.7
million tons this month based on the strong pace of
shipments and sales from the United States.  Canada
corn imports, however, are lowered 0.3 million tons
reflecting sharply higher wheat feeding.  Global coarse
grain ending stocks are raised 1.3 million tons with a
1.5-million-ton increase in corn stocks offset by slightly
lower barley and sorghum stocks.

RICE:  Only minor changes are made to the U.S.
2006/07 rice supply and use projections from a month
ago.  On the supply side, all rice imports are raised 0.5
million cwt to 18.5 million cwt with combined medium-
and short-grain imports raised 1.0 million cwt while long-
grain imports are lowered 0.5 million cwt.  On the use
side, all rice exports are unchanged at 102 million cwt.
However, exports of rough rice are lowered 2 million cwt
and entirely offset by an increase in the exports of milled
and brown rice (on a rough-equivalent basis).  Ending
stocks are raised slightly to 30.4 million cwt with long-
grain stocks projected at 21.6 million cwt, and combined
medium- and short-grain stocks projected at 7.9 million
cwt.  The season-average farm price range is lowered 5
cents per cwt on the low end and 15 cents on the high
end to $9.65 to $9.85 per cwt, which compares to a
revised $7.65 per cwt in 2005/06. 

Global 2006/07 rice production, trade, and ending stocks
are raised from a month ago.  The slight increase in
global rice production is due mostly to a larger crop
projected for Vietnam.  Imports are raised slightly due to
increases for EU-25 and the United States, while imports
for Russia are reduced slightly.  China exports are
raised from a month ago.  World rice ending stocks for
2006/07 are projected at 78.9 million tons, up 1.1 million
tons from last month, down 2.4 million tons from
2005/06, and the lowest stocks since 1983/84. 

OILSEEDS:  U.S. soybean exports for 2006/07 are
projected at 1.1 billion bushels, down 20 million from last
month, but still record high.  This month's reduction is
based on increased South America supply prospects
and reduced global import demand.  China projected
soybean imports are reduced to 31 million tons,
reflecting a slow start to the 2006/07 marketing year. 
With soybean crush unchanged, projected ending stocks
for 2006/07 are increased to a record 595 million
bushels.  

U.S. soybean and soybean product price projections for
2006/07 are raised this month.  The U.S. season-
average soybean price range is projected at $5.90 to
$6.50 per bushel, compared with $5.75 to $6.45 per
bushel last month.  Soybean meal prices are projected
at $180 to $195 per short ton, up $10 on both ends of
the range.  Soybean oil prices are projected at 27.5 to
29.5 cents per pound, up 1 cent on both ends of the
range.  Soybean oil prices remain relatively high despite
U.S. soybean oil stocks approaching record levels in
November and December.

Global oilseed production for 2006/07 is projected at
397.2 million tons, up 1.8 million tons from last month. 
Global soybean production is projected at a record 228.4
million tons, up 1.6 million tons from last month.  The
Argentina crop is raised 1.5 million tons to 44 million
tons based on slightly higher harvested area and
improved yield prospects.  Yields are projected at 2.79
tons per hectare, just below the record set in 2003. 
Soybean production is also raised for Russia and
Ukraine.  Other oilseed production changes include
increased sunflowerseed production for Ukraine, higher
cottonseed production for China, and reduced
cottonseed production for several African countries.

Global oilseed stocks are projected at a record 63.8
million tons, up 0.9 million tons from last month. 
Increased soybean stocks in South America account for
most of the change.  Global vegetable oil stocks are also
increased slightly, but remain near 30-year lows relative
to use.

SUGAR:  Projected 2006/07 U.S. sugar supply is
decreased 156,000 short tons, raw value, from last
month, due to lower production and imports.  Production
is decreased 17,000 tons, based on processor estimates
compiled by the Farm Service Agency.  Imports under
the tariff rate quota are decreased 114,000 tons: 
100,000 tons from Mexico based on reduced production
potential and 14,000 tons from Costa Rica.  Imports for
re-export are reduced 25,000 tons based on a slower
than expected pace to date.  Total sugar use is reduced
50,000 tons, as lower deliveries for domestic food use
more than offset higher exports; both changes are
based on pace to date.

LIVESTOCK, POULTRY, AND DAIRY:  Total U.S. meat
production for 2006 is reduced fractionally from last
month based on lower estimated fourth quarter
slaughter.  Forecast meat production for 2007 is lowered
from last month mainly due to smaller beef and broiler
output.  The recent Cattle report indicated that there was
little expansion of the cattle herd in 2006.  Total cattle
inventory was slightly higher on January 1, 2007, but the
2006 inventory was revised down.  The 2006 calf crop
was fractionally below the previous year.  Assuming
pasture conditions improve in the spring, relatively high
grain prices will encourage cattle to remain on grass
longer and slow feedlot placements.  Thus, beef
production forecasts for later in the year are reduced. 
Pork production forecasts are unchanged from last
month.  Broiler production for 2007 is reduced
throughout the year.  Recent broiler hatchery data point
to production restraint through the first half of 2007. 
Turkey production forecasts are unchanged.  Egg
production forecasts are reduced for the first half of
2007.

Price forecasts for 2007 are unchanged for cattle and
turkeys, but prices are higher for hogs, broilers, and
eggs.  Firm demand for pork is supporting hog prices
higher than expected and price forecasts are raised to
reflect continued demand conditions and additional
support from higher broiler prices.  As broiler meat
supplies are forecast lower than last month, prices are
forecast higher.  Egg prices are forecast higher on
slower expected production growth.

Beef, pork, and poultry trade forecasts for 2006 and
2007 are unchanged from last month.

The milk production forecasts for 2006 and 2007 are
raised from last month.  The recent Milk Production and
Cattle reports indicated that the dairy herd remains
above last year and producers reported a slightly larger
number of replacement dairy heifers.  Thus, forecast
cow numbers are increased from last month, but the
increase will likely be tempered by the recently
announced herd buyout by Cooperatives Working
Together and higher feed costs.  The 2007 forecast
continues to assume a declining cow herd from the
previous year, albeit at a slower pace than forecast last
month.  With a slight increase in milk per cow growth
and higher overall cow numbers, the milk production
forecast is increased 1.3 billion pounds from last month. 
Despite higher production, milk prices are forecast
higher.  Demand for dairy products remains firm,
although the butter price is reduced slightly on
expectations of ample supplies.  Cheese price forecasts
are slightly higher compared with last month as demand
remains strong.  However, nonfat dry milk (NDM) and
whey price forecasts are raised sharply.  Demand for
NDM and whey for both domestic ingredient use and
international sales support strong prices.  Supplies of
these products in international markets are expected to
remain tight until at least the second half of the year
when the next production season in Oceania begins. 
The all milk price forecast for 2007 is raised to $14.35 to
$15.05.

COTTON:  This month's 2006/07 U.S. cotton estimates
include sharply lower exports and higher ending stocks. 
No changes are made to production or domestic mill
use.  The export forecast is reduced nearly 8 percent to
14.5 million bales due to a combination of lower total
estimated imports by China and a lower expected U.S.
share of the China market.  Accordingly, ending stocks
are raised 1.2 million bales to 8.3 million.  The forecast
stocks-to-use ratio of 43 percent is the largest since
1988/89.

The world 2006/07 estimates include marginally lower
production and marginally higher consumption relative to
last month.  Production increases for China and
Pakistan are more than offset by reductions for
Australia, Mali, and others.  Consumption is raised
mainly in Turkey, partially offset by a reduction for Brazil. 
World trade is reduced about 1 percent, with imports
lower for China and India, but higher for Turkey.  Lower
forecast U.S. exports are nearly offset by higher exports
by India.  Despite lower production and higher
consumption, world stocks are raised 1.3 percent due
mainly to an increase in the residual supply factor for
China.  China's continued sluggish import demand
suggests that domestic supplies are higher than
previously estimated.

Notes: 

Public Law 106-78, signed October 22, 1999, requires the Secretary of
Agriculture to estimate and report the U.S. upland cotton season-ending
stocks-to-use ratio, excluding projected raw cotton imports but including the
quantity of raw cotton imports that has been imported during the marketing
year.  Pursuant to this requirement, the estimated ratio for 2006/07 is 43.6
percent.

A table including detail for upland and extra long staple (ELS) cotton will be

the February projection and the final estimate. Using world wheat production as
an example, changes between the February projection and the final estimate have
averaged 2.3 million tons (0.4%) ranging from -7.3 to 6.8 million tons. The
February  projection has been below the estimate 18 times and above 7 times.

1/ Final estimate for 1981/82-2005/06 is defined as the first November estimate
following the marketing year.  2/ May not total 25 if projection was the same
as final estimate. 3/ Includes corn, sorghum, barley, oats, rye, millet, and
mixed grain. 4/ Global soybean supply and use projections were initially
released in June 2004.  Therefore, an insufficient number of observations are
available to provide meaningful reliability statistics for global soybean
supply and use.
