WHEAT:  U.S. wheat ending stocks for 2009/10 are projected 
15 million bushels higher this month reflecting lower expected 
food use.  Food use is projected 15 million bushels lower 
based on the latest mill-grind data from the U.S. Census 
Bureau and indications of 2009-crop quality that suggest 
higher-than-normal flour extraction rates again in 2009/10.  
Higher flour extraction rates reduce the quantity of wheat 
needed for milling.  Food use for 2008/09 is estimated 1 
million bushels higher based on the latest revisions to mill-
grind data.  The marketing-year average farm price projection 
is unchanged at $4.65 to $5.05 per bushel.
 
Global wheat supplies for 2009/10 are projected 1.0 million 
tons higher as increased production in Canada and EU-27 
more than offset lower beginning stocks and production for 
Australia.  Global wheat production is projected 2.0 million 
tons higher.  Production is raised 2.5 million tons for Canada 
based on the latest estimates from Statistics Canada which 
sharply raised yields in the Prairie Provinces.  Production is 
revised 0.3 million tons higher for EU-27 based on an upward 
yield revision for Italy.  FSU-12 production is also raised 
slightly with a 0.2-million-ton increase in production for 
Belarus.  Partly offsetting is a 1.0-million-ton reduction for 
Australia production based on a downward revision to the 
latest government forecast.  Australia production is also 
lowered for 2007/08 and 2008/09 in line with recently revised 
government estimates.  These changes lower 2009/10 
Australia beginning stocks 0.8 million tons.

Global wheat trade for 2009/10 is projected slightly lower this 
month, mostly reflecting lower imports by Iran and lower 
exports by Australia and China.  Imports for Iran are lowered 
1.0 million tons based on the slower pace of reported 
shipments as compared with last year at this time.  Exports 
are lowered 0.5 million tons for Australia, reflecting tighter 
exportable supplies.  Exports are lowered 0.5 million tons for 
China based on the slow pace of shipments to date and 
relatively high internal wheat prices.  Exports are also 
lowered 0.2 million tons for India based on smaller-than-
expected recent shipments.  Partly offsetting is a 0.5-million-
ton increase in exports for Canada with larger available 
supplies.  Global consumption is lowered this month mostly 
reflecting a 1-million-ton reduction in expected EU-27 feeding 
and reductions of 0.8 million tons and 0.4 million tons, 
respectively, in food use in India and the United States.  With 
higher production and lower use, global ending stocks are 
raised 2.6 million tons. 

COARSE GRAINS:  U.S. feed grain ending stocks for 
2009/10 are projected higher this month with a reduction in 
expected corn exports.  Corn exports are lowered 50 million 
bushels based on the slow pace of shipments to date and 
increased competition from larger supplies in Ukraine.  
Projected U.S. corn ending stocks are raised 50 million 
bushels.  At the projected 1,675 million bushels, ending 
stocks would be nearly unchanged from 2008/09.  The 
2009/10 marketing-year average farm price projection for 
corn is unchanged at $3.25 to $3.85 per bushel.  
Global coarse grain supplies for 2009/10 are projected 3.0 
million tons lower mostly as a result of reduced India millet 
production.  Global coarse grain beginning stocks are 
lowered based on multiple year revisions that raise estimated 
corn feeding in Iran and barley consumption in Kazakhstan.  
World corn production is raised mostly reflecting a 0.5-million-
ton increase for Ukraine.  World barley production is raised 
1.0 million tons with increases for Australia, Canada, and 
Belarus.  World oat production is lowered slightly with small 
reductions for Canada and Australia more than offsetting an 
increase for Belarus.  Production changes for Australia, 
Belarus, and Canada reflect the latest government estimates 
from these countries.  India millet production is lowered 4.0 
million tons as area expansion on unplanted rice land was 
less than expected and the erratic monsoon season lowered 
yields.  Lower production reduces India millet consumption, 
but has little impact on global coarse grain trade.

Global coarse grain trade for 2009/10 is nearly unchanged 
this month as higher Ukraine corn exports offset lower U.S. 
corn exports and higher Australia barley exports offset lower 
EU-27 barley exports.  World coarse grain consumption is 
lowered mostly as a result of reduced India millet use.  
Sorghum consumption is also lowered reflecting a small 
reduction in food, seed, and industrial use for China and a 
small reduction in feed use for EU-27.  World barley 
consumption is raised with increased feed use for Canada 
and Australia and increased food, seed, and industrial use for 
Kazakhstan, Morocco, and Australia.  Mixed grain feeding is 
also raised for EU-27.  Global coarse grain ending stocks are 
down 0.8 million tons with reductions in projected stocks of 
mixed grains, millet, rye, barley, and oats more than offsetting 
an increase in sorghum.  World corn stocks are nearly 
unchanged.

RICE:  No changes are made on the U.S. 2009/10 rice supply 
side; however, on the use side exports are raised slightly and 
ending stocks lowered by the same amount.  Domestic and 
residual use is unchanged from last month.  The export 
projection is raised 1.0 million cwt to 97.0 million with rough 
rice exports raised 2.0 million, and combined brown and 
milled exports (rough-equivalent basis) lowered 1.0 million.  
The combined medium- and short-grain export projection is 
raised 1.0 million cwt to 29.0 million, while the long-grain 
export projection at 68.0 million is unchanged from last 
month.  The changes in the export projections are based on 
analysis of export data through September from the U.S. 
Census Bureau along with U.S. Export Sales report data 
through the end of November.  The pace of combined 
medium- and short-grain exports for both milled and rough 
rice are ahead of last year, while long-grain exports in both 
categories are lagging a year ago.  Ending stocks are 
projected at 43.2 million cwt, 1.0 million below last month, 
with the reduction all in combined medium- and short-grain. 

The all rice season-average farm price for 2009/10 is forecast 
at $13.90 to $14.90 per cwt, up 5 cents per cwt on both ends 
of the range.  The long-grain season-average farm price 
range is projected at $12.60 to $13.60 per cwt, up 10 cents 
per cwt on each end of the range.  The combined medium- 
and short-grain farm price range is projected at $17.75 to 
$18.75 per cwt, down 25 cents per cwt on each end.  U.S. 
long-grain prices have been supported largely on an increase 
in import demand led by increased import activity by the 
Philippines, while medium-grain prices have softened since 
the beginning of the marketing year.

World 2009/10 rice supply and use projections are raised 
from a month ago.  Global rice production is projected at 
433.9 million tons, up 1.8 million from a month ago largely on 
increases for China, Thailand, Vietnam, and South Korea 
offset some by reductions for Brazil, North Korea, and the 
Philippines.  Global exports are increased 0.8 million tons 
largely on expected increases for India and China.  The 
increase for India is based on larger expected exports of 
basmati rice to markets in the Middle East.  The increase for 
China is based largely on an increase in available exportable 
supplies due to an increase in production.  Global ending 
stocks for 2009/10 are projected at 89.5 million tons, up 3.5 
million from last month, but 2.1 million below 2008/09.  The 
increase in stocks is mostly due to larger stocks projected for 
Thailand, India, and Vietnam. 

OILSEEDS:  Total U.S. oilseed production for 2009/10 is 
projected at 97.9 million tons, up fractionally due to a small 
increase in cottonseed.  Soybean exports are increased 15 
million bushels to 1.34 billion reflecting the record export 
pace in recent weeks and higher projected soybean imports 
by China.  U.S. export commitments (shipments plus 
outstanding sales) were record high through November, up 
almost 60 percent from a year ago.  With projected crush 
unchanged, soybean ending stocks for 2009/10 are projected 
at 255 million bushels, down 15 million from last month.
 
Soybeans and product price projections are all higher this 
month.  The U.S. season-average soybean price range for 
2009/10 is projected at $8.75 to $10.25 compared with $8.20 
to $10.20 last month.  The soybean meal price is projected at 
$260 to $310 per short ton, up $10 on the bottom of the 
range.  Soybean oil prices are projected at 35.5 to 38.5 cents 
per pound compared with 33 to 37 cents last month.

Global oilseed production for 2009/10 is projected at 428.6 
million tons, down 0.3 million from last month.  Foreign 
oilseed production accounts for most of the change with 
increases for soybeans, rapeseed, and cottonseed more than 
offset by reductions for sunflowerseed and peanuts.  Global 
rapeseed production is projected at a record 59.4 million 
tons, up 1.3 million from last month with gains for Canada 
more than offsetting lower production for India.  Canadian 
rapeseed production is raised 1.6 million tons to 11.8 million 
based on the latest survey results from Statistics Canada.  
Higher-than-expected yields account for the change.  India 
rapeseed production is lowered due to reduced harvested 
area.  Hot, dry conditions during much of the planting season 
prevented area from reaching earlier expectations.  Global 
sunflowerseed production is projected at 30.7 million tons, 
down 1 million from last month.  Lower production in 
Argentina and Russia account for most of the change.  Other 
changes include reduced peanut production for China and 
India, and increased cottonseed production for Pakistan.

Global oilseed trade is projected at 94.4 million tons, up 0.7 
million from last month.  Increased rapeseed exports from 
Canada and Australia and increased soybean exports from 
the United States account for most of the change.  China 
soybean imports are raised 0.5 million tons to 41 million, just 
below the record 41.1 million imported in 2008/09.

SUGAR:  Projected 2009/10 sugar supply and use are 
unchanged from last month.  Compared with a year earlier, 
supply is projected at 11.6 million short tons, raw value, down 
5.2 percent.  Total use is projected at 10.6 million tons, down 
1.9 percent.  Ending stocks, at 1 million tons, are down 
435,000 tons.

LIVESTOCK, POULTRY, AND DAIRY:  Total U.S. meat 
production for 2009 is forecast slightly lower as fourth-quarter 
broiler production is reduced, more than offsetting small 
increases to the beef production forecast.  Egg production is 
forecast slightly higher.

Meat production for 2010 is lowered from last month as 
forecasts for beef, pork, and poultry meat production are 
reduced.  Cattle slaughter is unchanged but carcass weights 
in the first quarter are forecast lower.  Hog slaughter is 
reduced on lower expected hog imports from Canada.  
Growth in broiler and turkey production is slower as hatchery 
data show few signs of expansion.

Red meat export forecasts for 2009 and 2010 are raised.  
Beef exports are forecast higher on expected economic 
recovery in a number of markets.  Pork exports for 2009 are 
increased because third-quarter shipments were stronger 
than expected, and higher 2010 pork exports reflect improved 
economic prospects in several markets.  The poultry export 
forecast for 2009 is adjusted to reflect higher third-quarter 
shipments.  

Cattle price forecasts are reduced for 2009 and 2010 as 
relatively weak demand for beef is expected to pressure 
prices.  The hog price forecasts are raised for fourth-quarter 
2009 and first-quarter 2010.  The broiler price is lowered for 
2009; turkey price forecasts are raised for 2009 and 2010.  
The egg price forecast is increased for 2009 and 2010 as 
demand for eggs has strengthened in the fourth quarter.

The milk production forecasts are raised for 
2009 and 2010.  Dairy cow liquidation has been slower than 
expected, and improving milk prices in 2010 are expected to 
diminish the rate of decline in cow numbers.  Dairy exports 
for 2009 are raised slightly, reflecting third-quarter strength in 
cheese and nonfat dry milk demand.  Import forecasts are 
lowered for 2009.  Fat-basis ending stocks are forecast 
higher for 2010.  Although milk production is forecast higher 
than last month, improving demand is expected to support 
prices for most products.  Prices for cheese, nonfat dry milk, 
and whey are forecast higher, but butter prices are forecast 
slightly lower.  The Class III price forecast for 2009 is raised 
from last month and both Class III and Class IV prices are 
forecast higher for 2010.  The all milk price is forecast at 
$12.70 to $12.80 per cwt for 2009 and $16.35 to $17.15 for 
2010.

COTTON:  This month’s U.S. 2009/10 cotton forecasts 
include a slight increase in production, higher exports, and 
lower ending stocks.  Production is raised 96,000 bales from 
last month as reductions for the Mississippi Delta states are 
more than offset by increases in the other three regions.  
Domestic mill use is unchanged.  Exports are raised 500,000 
bales due to higher expected foreign import demand.  Ending 
stocks are forecast at 4.5 million, 400,000 bales below last 
month and 31 percent of total use.  The average price 
received by producers is forecast at 56 to 64 cents per 
pound, 4 cents higher on each end of the range.

The world cotton 2009/10 forecasts include lower beginning 
stocks and higher consumption relative to last month, 
resulting in a 3.6-percent reduction in ending stocks.  
Beginning stocks are lowered mainly in India and Uzbekistan 
due to adjustments in the prior-year balance sheets.  
Production is lowered in India and Peru, but is raised in 
Pakistan and the United States.  World consumption is raised 
1.0 million bales from last month, including increases for 
China, India, Vietnam, Uzbekistan, and Thailand.  World 
trade also is raised due to increased demand by several 
importing countries, which is partially offset by a reduction for 
Pakistan.  The China import forecast is increased 500,000 
bales to 9.0 million as the government has recently 
announced larger-than-expected import quotas, thereby 
removing a key constraint on imports and consumption.  
Exports are raised in the United States, Brazil, India, 
Pakistan, and Greece, but are lowered in Uzbekistan.  World 
ending stocks are now forecast at 51.8 million bales.

the December projection and the final estimate. Using world wheat production as
an example, changes between the December projection and the final estimate have
averaged 3.9 million tons (0.7%) ranging from -10.2 to 6.1 million tons. The
December projection has been below the estimate 19 times and above 9 times.
