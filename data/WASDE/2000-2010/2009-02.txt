WHEAT:  U.S. wheat supply, use, and stocks projections for 2008/09 are 
unchanged this month.  The season-average price received by 
producers is projected at $6.70 to $6.90 per bushel, up 20 cents on the 
bottom end of the range reflecting continued strength in reported farm 
prices.

Global 2008/09 wheat production is nearly unchanged from last month at 
682.8 million tons.  Reductions for Argentina and EU-27 are nearly offset 
by increases for Russia, Ukraine, and Australia.  Production is lowered 
1.1 million tons for Argentina as drought affected yields have proven 
even lower than previously thought.  EU-27 output is reduced 0.2 million 
tons on official government revisions for the United Kingdom and 
Hungary.  Russia and Ukraine production are raised 0.7 million tons and 
0.4 million tons, respectively, on the latest government indications.  
Production is raised 0.2 million tons for Australia on higher yields.  
Australia production is also raised 0.8 million tons for 2007/08 in line with 
upward government revisions to area and yields.

World wheat imports for 2008/09 are nearly unchanged this month.  
Imports are lowered 1.0 million tons for Brazil and reduced 0.2 million 
tons each for Morocco, Nigeria, and Vietnam.  Reductions of 0.1 million 
tons each are projected for Taiwan and Venezuela.  Imports are raised 
1.0 million tons for Iran, 0.3 million tons for Pakistan, 0.2 million tons 
each for Syria and Turkey, and 0.1 million tons for Israel.  Import 
changes mostly reflect the pace of shipments to date and indications of 
purchasing by these countries.  Exports are lowered 0.8 million tons for 
Argentina, 0.5 million tons for China, and 0.4 million tons for Brazil.  
These reductions are partly offset by increases of 0.5 million tons each 
for Turkey and Ukraine and 0.2 million tons each for India and Paraguay.

World wheat consumption is lowered 1.5 million tons mostly reflecting 
lower expected food use in Argentina, Morocco, Nigeria, Venezuela, and 
Vietnam.  The reduction in Argentina reflects lower available supplies 
with reduced production.  Reductions for the other countries reflect lower 
expected imports.  World wheat feed and residual use is down slightly 
this month with a 2.0-million-ton reduction for EU-27 mostly offset by 
increases of 0.7 million tons for Russia, 0.4 million tons each for Syria 
and Ukraine, 0.3 million tons for Canada, and 0.1 million tons for Israel.  
Increased barley feeding in EU-27 offsets the reduction in wheat.  Higher 
wheat production in Russia and Ukraine is expected to increase handling 
and storage losses which are accounted for as higher feed and residual 
use.  Global ending stocks are increased 1.6 million tons with increases 
for EU-27, Iran, Australia, China, and Pakistan partly offset by reductions 
for Turkey, Ukraine, Brazil, Canada, Syria, Argentina, and India.

COARSE GRAINS:  There are no changes this month to the U.S. corn 
balance sheet.  Sorghum food, seed, and industrial use is projected 40 
million bushels higher based on indications of increased sorghum use by 
ethanol plants in the Southern and Central Plains.  Sorghum prices are 
well below those for corn in these areas and supplies are plentiful with 
this year=s slower export pace.  Ethanol blender and producer margins 
have recently improved and weekly production of gasoline blends with 
ethanol has risen.   Sorghum feed and residual use is lowered 10 million 
bushels leaving projected ending stocks down 30 million bushels.  Barley 
food, seed, and industrial use is raised 10 million bushels on strong 
exports of barley malt.  Barley feed and residual use is lowered an 
offsetting amount.  

The projected season-average farm price range for corn is narrowed 10 
cents on each end to $3.65 to $4.15 per bushel.  The price range for 
sorghum is narrowed 15 cents on each end to $3.05 to $3.35 per bushel. 
 The oats farm price is raised 10 cents on each end of the range to $3.00 
to $3.20 per bushel based on reported prices to date.

Global coarse grain supplies for 2008/09 are lowered 0.9 million tons this 
month with reductions in corn production for South America and India 
only partly offset by increases for FSU-12 coarse grains, increases for 
Australia barley and sorghum, and higher barley beginning stocks in 
Australia based on revisions to 2007/08 production.

World corn production for 2008/09 is lowered 4.6 million tons.  Argentina 
production is lowered 3.0 million tons as continued drought and heat 
during late January further reduced prospects for yields and harvested 
area in key central growing areas.  Brazil production is lowered 2.0 
million tons reflecting a return to dryness in late January that limited soil 
moisture during grain fill in drought-affected southern growing areas.  
Corn production is also lowered 0.8 million tons in adjacent Paraguay 
which experienced similar weather problems this season.  Corn 
production is lowered 0.5 million tons for India as lower yields more than 
offset an increase in harvested area.  Production is lowered 0.2 million 
tons for Russia, but increased 1.4 million tons for Ukraine on the latest 
government indications.

Other coarse grain production changes partly offset lower world corn 
output.  Barley production is raised 0.6 million tons for Russia and 0.1 
million tons for Ukraine on the latest government estimates.  Oats 
production is raised 0.4 million tons for Russia and 0.2 million tons for 
Ukraine on the same indications.  Australia barley production is raised 
0.5 million tons mostly on higher harvested area and sorghum production 
is raised 0.4 million tons on higher expected yields. 

World coarse grain imports and exports for 2008/09 are both lowered 
this month mostly on lower projected corn trade.  World corn imports are 
lowered 2.0 million tons with reductions for South Korea, Mexico, Saudi 
Arabia, Tunisia, Chile, and Peru as feed use is projected lowered for 
most of these countries.  Corn feeding is lowered 3.0 million tons for 
Brazil, 0.8 million tons for Argentina, and 0.2 million tons for India.  
Sorghum imports and feeding are raised 0.3 million tons for Mexico, 
partly offsetting reductions for corn.  Globally, corn feeding is projected 
down 5.8 million tons this month.  Increases in barley and oats feeding of 
3.0 million tons and 0.6 million tons, respectively, are only partly 
offsetting.  Despite the drop in world corn production this month, ending 
stocks for 2008/09 are projected 0.6 million tons higher on lower 
expected global consumption.

RICE: No changes are made on the supply side of the U.S. 2008/09 rice 
supply and use balance.  However, all rice exports for 2008/09 are 
lowered 3 million cwt to 98 million, all in the long-grain and combined 
milled-and-brown export categories.  Domestic and residual use is 
unchanged.  The decline in use resulted in an increase in ending stocks 
to 26.2 million cwt, up 13 percent from last month. 

The all rice season-average farm price for 2008/09 is forecast at $16.00 
to $17.00 per cwt, down 50 cents per cwt on both ends of the range from 
a month ago.  The long-grain season-average farm price range is 
projected at $15.00 to $16.00 per cwt, down 50 cents per cwt on each 
end of the range.  The combined medium- and short-grain farm price 
range is projected at $20.50 to $21.50 per cwt, down $1.00 per cwt on 
each end.  The downward adjustment in prices is due both to weak 
demand for U.S. rice (particularly for long-grain) and large changes to 
the monthly farm prices reported by the National Agricultural Statistics 
Service (NASS) in the January issue of Agricultural Prices. 

Global 2008/09 rice production and ending stocks are raised from a 
month ago, while consumption and trade are lowered.  The increase in 
global production is due to a number of small upward adjustments 
including EU-27, the Philippines, Russia, and Nicaragua, which are 
partially offset by a slight reduction for Thailand.  World exports are 
lowered because of reductions for India, Thailand, and the United States, 
which are partially offset by an increase for Burma.  Import projections 
for 2008/09 are lowered for EU-27 and the Philippines which are partially 
offset by increases for Liberia, Syria, and Malaysia.  Global ending 
stocks are raised from a month ago with increases made to a number of 
countries including India, Thailand, and the United States.  World rice 
ending stocks for 2008/09 are projected at 84.6 million tons, up nearly 2 
million tons from last month, and 5.6 million above 2007/08.

OILSEEDS:  Projected U.S. soybean ending stocks for 2008/09 are 
reduced to 210 million bushels, down 15 million from last month as 
increased exports more than offset lower crush.  Soybean exports are 
raised 50 million bushels to 1.150 billion as export shipments continue to 
exceed earlier projections, primarily for China.  Soybean crush is 
reduced 35 million bushels to 1.650 billion reflecting a continuation of the 
weak domestic soybean meal disappearance that began during the 
summer of 2008.  Soybean oil stocks are projected higher this month as 
reduced production is more than offset by lower use.  Domestic soybean 
oil disappearance is reduced mainly due to lower projected use for 
biodiesel production.  The soybean oil export projection is also reduced 
this month reflecting weak sales and shipments through the first 4 
months of the marketing year.

The U.S. season-average soybean price range for 2008/09 is projected 
at $8.75 to $9.75 per bushel, up 25 cents on both ends of the range.  
The soybean meal price is projected at $265 to $305 per short ton 
compared with $250 to $310 last month.  The soybean oil price is 
projected at 31 to 34 cents per pound, down 1.0 cents on both ends of 
the range.

Global oilseed production for 2008/09 is projected at 408 million tons, 
down 8.3 million tons from last month.  Lower soybean and 
sunflowerseed production more than offsets increases for rapeseed and 
peanuts.  Global soybean production is reduced 9.1 million tons to 224.1 
million tons.  The reduction is due to South American crops which have 
been affected by hot, dry weather during critical parts of the growing 
season.  Soybean production for Argentina is projected at 43.8 million 
tons, down 5.7 million from last month as drought conditions and heat in 
the central growing area has resulted in lower projected harvested area 
and yields.  Soybean production for Brazil is projected at 57 million tons, 
down 2 million due to dry conditions especially in the southern producing 
areas.  Paraguay soybean production is reduced to 4 million tons, down 
1.6 million, also due to hot, dry weather.  Global sunflowerseed 
production is projected lower due to reductions for Argentina and EU-27. 
 Global rapeseed production is raised this month due to larger projected 
crops for India and Ukraine.  Other changes include higher peanut 
production for India, and higher sunflowerseed production for Ukraine.

Global oilseed stocks are projected at 61.6 million tons, down 3.8 million 
tons.  Most of the decline is due to lower soybean stocks in the U.S., 
Brazil, and Argentina.  

SUGAR:  Projected 2008/09 U.S. sugar supply is decreased 46,000 
short tons, raw value, from last month, due to reduced production more 
than offsetting increased imports and revised higher beginning stocks.  
Reduced forecast sugarcane production in Florida lowers cane sugar 
production 85,000 tons while information from mills in Louisiana and 
Texas provides a partial offset.  Imports are increased 35,000 tons, due 
to higher imports from Mexico and Peru more than offsetting lower 
imports from Canada.  Exports are reduced 40,000 tons based on the 
slow pace to date.  Sugar use is unchanged.

LIVESTOCK, POULTRY, AND DAIRY:  Total U.S. meat production for 
2009 is forecast lower this month based on reductions of both red meats 
and poultry.  The January 30 Cattle report estimated lower cattle 
inventories, including the lowest beef cow inventory since 1963, lower 
retained heifers, and a smaller 2008 calf crop.  Although the number of 
cattle outside feedlots is slightly higher than last year, the base is lower, 
reflecting downward revisions in historical inventories and calf crops.  As 
a result, fewer numbers of cattle are forecast to be placed on feed 
leading to lower beef production in 2009.  There is a slight offset due to a 
higher cow slaughter forecast, reflecting dairy herd reductions in the 
latter part of the year.  Pork production is forecast lower than last month 
as the pace of hog slaughter during the first quarter has been slower 
than expected.  Broiler production forecasts are lowered as hatchery 
data point to continued reductions in eggs set and chicks placed.  Turkey 
producers are also reducing hatchery flocks at a more rapid pace than 
previously expected.  Egg production is forecast higher as producers 
respond to recent high prices.

Export forecasts are reduced for most major species meats.  Economic 
uncertainty continues to weigh on foreign demand, and exports to most 
major markets are expected to remain relatively weak.

Cattle and hog price forecasts are reduced, reflecting weakness in red 
meat demand which more than offsets the price-supporting effects of 
tighter animal supplies.  Broiler and turkey price forecasts are unchanged 
from last month as the forecast production declines are expected to 
largely offset weakness in demand.
                                                       
Milk production forecasts for 2009 are lowered from last month.  The 
January 30 Cattle report estimated that dairy cow inventories on January 
1, 2009, were almost 1 percent above a year earlier and only fractionally 
fewer heifers were being retained for addition to dairy herds.  Assuming 
no significant herd reductions in the first part of the year, producer 
returns are expected to be heavily pressured resulting in a relatively 
sharp reduction in inventories during the latter part of the year.  Output 
per cow is unchanged from last month.  Both domestic and export 
demand is forecast to remain weak due to economic uncertainty.  
Commercial export forecasts for 2009 are reduced from last month as 
weak international demand and expected competition from recently 
announced subsidized EU-27 exports limit opportunities for commercial 
exports.  Conversely, lower international prices are expected to result in 
slightly higher U.S. imports of dairy products, primarily cheese.  Fat basis 
ending stocks are forecast lower as supplies tighten later in the year on 
lower milk production, but skim-solids stocks are raised as exports of 
nonfat dry milk (NDM) are limited and supplies burden the market.  Sales 
of butter and NDM to the CCC are forecast higher.  

Milk and dairy product price estimates for 2009 are reduced as first-half 
product prices are expected to be pressured by the confluence of weak 
demand and burdensome supplies.  As milk production is reduced, 
especially in the latter part of the year, tighter milk supplies are expected 
to help lift second half prices from their midyear lows.  However, weaker 
forecast exports and continued weakness in domestic demand keep 
prices later in the year lower than forecast last month.  As a result, the 
annual average product and Class prices are forecast below last month.  
The all milk price is also forecast lower, $10.95 to $11.65 per cwt in 2009.

Estimates for 2008 have been revised to reflect actual data.  Milk 
production estimates are raised slightly based on December milk 
production.  Based on trade data to date, exports are estimated lower 
than last month and imports, primarily on a fat basis, are forecast higher. 
 Ending stocks are adjusted to reflect December data and revisions to 
NDM stocks.

COTTON:  The 2008/09 U.S. supply and demand cotton estimates 
include sharply lower domestic mill use and exports compared with last 
month, raising ending stocks nearly 12 percent to 7.7 million bales.  The 
cotton production estimate is unchanged.  Domestic mill use is reduced 7 
percent to 3.9 million bales based on recent activity.  U.S. exports are 
reduced 500,000 bales to 11.5 million, due to lower projected foreign 
imports, especially by China.  The forecast for the average market price 
received by producers of 47 to 54 cents per pound is raised 3 cents on 
the lower end and 2 cents on the upper end of the range, reflecting 
higher than anticipated prices to date.

The 2008/09 world cotton supply and demand estimates show marginally 
lower production, and sharply lower consumption and trade relative to 
last month.  Production is reduced in Pakistan, Argentina, and Mexico.  
Consumption is cut more than 2 percent from last month’s estimate as 
the world economy continues to perform below previous expectations, 
resulting in a buildup of textile inventories and idling of spinning capacity. 
 Consumption is reduced in China, Turkey, the United States, Pakistan, 
Russia, India, Indonesia, and other countries, but is raised in Thailand.  If 
realized, the forecast year-to-year decline of 8.2 percent would be the 
largest since 1937/38.  With lower consumption, world stocks are raised 
nearly 4 percent from last month to 61.7 million bales.

World trade in 2008/09 is lowered nearly 6 percent from last month due 
to lower projected imports by China and others.  The reduction of 1.0 
million bales in China’s imports is indicated by lower consumption and 
the potential availability of surplus stocks from the government’s reserve. 
 Exports are reduced for most of the world’s major suppliers, especially 
the Central Asian countries, India, and the United States.  Export market 
share for Central Asia and India is expected to decline in 2008/09 due to 
offering prices that are above world market-clearing levels.

the February projection and the final estimate. Using world wheat production as
an example, changes between the February projection and the final estimate have
averaged 2.4 million tons (0.4%) ranging from -7.3 to 6.8 million tons. The
February projection has been below the estimate 20 times and above 7 times.
